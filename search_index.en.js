painting on 2.4 GHz.\nRTL-SDR Tutorial: Cheap ADS-B aircraft radar\n\nI bought a RTL2832U receiver, that can operate on a range of 70-1700 Mhz.\n\nAliexpress link.\nLibraries and Programs\nAfter some time (6 months, hell yeah Brazil...) to receive the package, I begun to install all the programs and libraries to use the RTL.\n\n\n\ngnuradio :&nbsp;GNU Radio is a free software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software-defined radios and signal processing systems. It\ncan be used with external RF hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like environment. It is widely used in hobbyist, academic, and\ncommercial environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems. (ty wikipedia).\n\n\n\nrtl-sdr have:\n\n\n`\n\n`\n\ngqrx-sdr is a RF receive interface that have a displays FFT plot and spectrum waterfall very helpful to detect signals, &nbsp;the software includes AM, SSB, FM-N, FM-W (mono\nand stereo) demodulators and Special FM mode for NOAA APT.\n\n\nAfter installed all the software and plugging the receiver on the computer, we can see that have a Realtek chip with the lsusb feedback.\n\nOk, now with everything done, &nbsp;we can capture some data ! We can use the rtl-sdr toolkit.\n\nThe capture.bin is the file that will have the IQ data, 1.8&nbsp;MHz is the sample frequency and the frequency that we will look for is 100.9MHz (Rádio Atlântida), the radio\nstation.\nWarning !! 1.8e6 samples for second, so take 3~10 seconds because the fast growing of the file.\nTo demodulate we need do understand the modulation.\nThe FM is a method&nbsp;to modulate a message $m(t)$ with the change of&nbsp;the carrier ![cos(2\\pi f_c t)]  phase's . Wikipedia is your friend.\nThe phase have a relationship with the message, that is&nbsp;.

This post will try to itemize the most important items that can used for software collaboration.\nBefore starting, be sure to follow my previous posts, this post complements what already exists.\n\nNow, I'm going to throw some good practices of code development and contribution, and during this post I'll explain why such practices can be archived without much effort:\n\n\nAvoid creating multiple PRs for the same work, update the ones that are still open.\n\nE.g: You created a Pull Request called \"Feature: add button\", some modifications will be necessary after the review process, and for that you'll need to update the same branch over creating new ones. That's necessary to help the project maintainers to see previous comments and your development history, avoid repository noise and unnecessary PRs in the project history. Creating multiple PRs will only make the maintainers confuse and unable to track old comments, suggestions and your code changes between PRs.\n\n\n\nCreate atomic and self-contained commits, avoid doing multiple things in the same commit.\n\nE.g: You have created a commit to fix the serial communication class, and inside the same commit you are doing 3 different things, removing trailing spaces, fixing a pointer validation check and a typo in the documentation of a totally different class. This can appear to be silly and bureaucratic, but there are good reasons to break this simple commit and at least 3 different commits, one for the pointer check, a second one for the typo and a third one for the trailing space.\n\nIt makes your work more clear when the maintainer does the review per commit\nMakes it easier for developers to cherry-pick your work avoiding conflicts\nMakes it easier to fix conflicts when doing rebases over the master branch\n\n\nHelps developers to read the project history\nDevelopers usually track lines history to understand the changes behind a functionality, it's common to search with git grep history from commits or lines changes in specific commits to understand the code, function, class or a small feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate atomic and self-sustained PRs, avoid doing multiple things in the same PR, like different features. They may appear simple with small pieces of code/functionality but they can escalate quickly after a review process, and if both features are somehow related or dependently, it's recommended to break it in multiple PRs with code to maintain compatibility with current code base. A huge PR can drag developer and maintainer in a rabbit hole, making the PR to be not merged, keeping it simple is the best way to merge it and get the sweet serotonin boost.\n\nE.g: You have applied a PR for software notifications, and somehow you also added a URL fetch functionality to grab new software versions, etc. After the first review, the maintainer asks to create a more abstracted way to fetch api and to deal with network requirements, this will start to convolute the PR, moving the initial idea of the notification feature to an entire network REST API architecture. With that, it's better to break the PR in two, one that only provides the notification software and interface feature and a second PR that is used for the REST API.\n\n\n\nDo your own review, the final and probably most important tip of all. Doing you own review will train your mind and eyes to detect poor code standards or bad practices, it'll also make your PR be merged easily and faster, since you'll be able to catch problems before the reviewer feedback. Some reviewers may think that reviewing your own PR is a must, since we are talking about open source projects and free software, you should understand that the people that are reviewing your code are not obligated to do so, the majority are collaborating and donating their own time to help the development and maintenance of such projects, doing your own review is also sign of empathy about the project and maintainer time.\n\n\n","id":"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/how-to-rock-contribution-tips/","title":"How to rock: Doing the right thing"},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/how-to-rock-first-tips/":{"body":"After working for some time collaborating with open source/free software projects, I started to help newcomers to contribute and push the development further with good practices.\nThis post will try to itemize some important tips that can be used for software collaboration and personal projects, hopefully it'll help you to have a solid ground of good practices and advices for your contributions in a project. It contains information abut good code practices, a simple guide of helpful API design, code organization, comments, naming variables, development flow and self-criticism. Please enjoy, and any feedback (including critics) is much appreciated!\nCode practices\n\n\nEncapsulate magic variables:\n\nAs you can see, the final version makes everything more readable, we know that we are starting the communication with a vehicle that has an id of 0 and the vehicle probably contains a component with id 1, and while calling this function we are also requesting the status. Much better than 0, 1 and 232 right ?\nDoing this will help the reviewers and future developers to understand what is the meaning of such numbers.\nIt's also necessary to avoid variables that contains only single letters or really short abbreviations, is much harder to understand this: $$C^2 = A^2 + B^2$$\nover this: $$hypotenuse^2 = catheti_1^2 + catheti_2^2$$\n\n\nAvoid multiple arguments:\n\nBoth second and C++20/C++11 alternatives are valid for a better readability of the code, to choose between both alternatives will depend of how are you going to design your API, probably if you are more familiar with the Qt API, the second version appears to be the most common, the C++20/C++11 alternative appears to be a bit more verbose but can be useful to avoid multiple function calls and helpful when dealing with a simpler code base.\n\n\nEncapsulate code when necessary, try to break functions in a more readable and explanatory way:\n\nAs you can see, the reason behind each block of code is clear now, and with that, the comments are also not necessary anymore, the code is friendly and readable enough that's possible to understand it without any comments, the function name does the job for free.\n\n\nAvoid comments, that's a clickbait, comments are really necessary, but they may be unnecessary when you are doing something that's really straightforward, and sometimes when something isn't, it's better to encapsulate it.\n\nBefore checking the final version, let me talk more about it:\n\n\nFor each line of code you'll have a comment (like a parrot that repeat what we say), and the worst thing about these comments is that the content is exactly what you can read from the code! You can think that this kind of comment is dead code, something that has the same meaning as the code, but it does not run, resulting in a duplicated amount of lines to maintain. If you forget to update each comment for each line of code, you'll have a comment that does not match with the code, and this will be pretty confuse for someone that's reading it.\n\n\nOne of the most important skills about writing comments, is to know when not to write it!\n\n\nA comment should bring a value to the code, if you can remove the comment and the code can be understandable by a newcomer, the comment is not important.\n\n\n\nThere is a good video about this subject by Walter E. Brown in cppcon 2017, \"Whitespace ≤ Comments ＜＜ Code\".\nAnd to finish, you should not avoid comments, you should understand when comments are necessary, like this:\n\nMostly of the lines in this code can be impossible to understand without access or reading the datasheet directly,\nthe comments are here to understand what is going on and why, otherwise anyone that'll touch this code will need to do a reverse engineer to understand it.\n\n\nDevelopment flow\n\n\nAvoid creating multiple Pull Requests (PRs), update the ones that are still open.\n\nE.g: You created a Pull Request called \"Add button feature\", some modifications will be necessary after the review process, and for that you'll need to update the same branch over creating new ones. That's necessary to help the project maintainers to see previous comments and the development history. Creating multiple PRs will only make the maintainers confuse and unable to track old comments, suggestions and your code changes between PRs.\n\n\n\nCreate atomic and self-contained commits, avoid doing multiple tasks in the same commit.\n\n\nE.g: You created a commit to fix the serial communication class, and inside the same commit you are doing 3 different tasks, removing trailing spaces, fixing a pointer validation check and a typo in the documentation of a different class. This appear to be silly and bureaucratic, but there are good reasons to break this simple commit and at least 3 different commits, one for the pointer check, a second one for the typo and a third one for the trailing space.\nDevelopers usually track lines history to understand the changes behind a functionality, it's common to search with grep history from commits or line changes in specific commits to understand the history of a library, function, class, or a small feature, if the commits start to be polluted with unnecessary changes, this development practice will be almost impossible to be done, since a bunch of unrelated lines will me changed between commits and this technic will be unable to help the dear developer. git blame will also be of little help.\nThe example was also really simple, but you can imagine what happens if you change different parts of the code, for unrelated things, and a bug appears, technics such as git bisect will still work, but the result will be much harder to understand and to find which line is the one that created such bug.\n\n\n\n\nCreate atomic and self-sustained PRs, avoid doing multiple things in the same PR, like different features. They may appear simple with small pieces of code/functionality but they can escalate quickly after a review process, and if both features are somehow related or dependently, it's recommended to break it in multiple PRs with code to maintain compatibility with current code base.\n\nE.g: You have applied a PR for software notifications, and somehow you also added a URL fetch functionality to grab new software versions from the server.

Tig is one of the greatest tools to be used with Git, is the UI that mostly programmers are missing to visualize and understand what is going on in the git repository. If you didn't know about it, install and use it now.\n\n  \n  \n    tig --all\n  \n\nTig also allow a bunch of useful arguments, such as log, show, status, reflog, blame, grep, refs, stash and others, we are going to talk about some of these later.\nGit commit --fixup\nOh my, you need to fix an old commit on your PR ? That's a great use of fixup.\nYou can create a commit that fixes an old commit with git commit -a --fixup 00112233, but who has time to write hashs or copying/pasting it ?\nFor that, you can create a helpful git alias such as:\n\nWith that, you can use fit fix-old 3 to fix the HEAD~3 commit.\nGit rebase -i (Interactive rebase)\nInteractive rebase is a powerful command, and much more powerful and human friend with interactive mode.\n\n  \n  \n    git rebase -i --autosquash origin/master\n  \n\nOh well, you can see the autosquash option there, this is something that I do to apply fixups automatically on the correct commits, neat right ?\nGit reflog\ngit reflog is one of the most important commands, it provides access to everything that is tracked or was tracked by git, all commands and actions that was done in the entire history of the project can be accessed, it's possible to checkout and see the history of development tree in any moment, before or during a rebase, the history of a branch before a terrible idea in the code, a point between a merge conflict, everything is possible to recover or to start from a previous point, if you have done any git command with tracked files, you'll not loose it.\nFor an awesome experience, I recommend to use tig with reflog (tig reflog) to see a user-friendly history of reflog.\n\n  \n  \n    checkout, rebase, reset, cherry-pick, the history is all there and you can checkout in any hash!\n  \nGit add/checkout/stash --patch/-p\n\n  \n  \n    git add -p, add only what you need\n  \n\nThe --patch argument is a great feature, you can use it with add, checkout, stash and others, it allows your to select what you need in your commit,\nit helps to avoid adding unnecessary stuff in your commit and only adding what is needed for an atomic patch.\nGit stash\nSometimes we want to remove everything that we are working on, a bunch of uncommitted or unstaged code around your project, but at the same time, we are a big afraid to remove and loose all this code. The answer for your problems is git stash, git will get everything that is not staged.\nTo visualize what was stashed, you can run git stash show stash@{0} --all where 0 can be the nth stash. You can also visualize it with tig stash;\nIf you want to apply any stashed code, you can do it with git stash apply stash@{0}, again, where 0 can be the nth stash.\nGit cherry-pick\nIf you want to test some commits or apply in different branches for any reason, git cherry-pick is here for you, with it you can just copy a commit or a range of commits to apply over a specific branch.\nKnowing the basic (How the flow works)\n\nThis part was the first section of this post, but since I went really deep about how git works, it's now in the end as a bonus section.\n\n\nAn alternative title could be: 'Introduction to Git flow', I hope that you understand what kind of introduction I'm talking about :)\n\nWell, if you thought about 'the flow' as related to branches, I can't blame you. First we need to go to the basics, before branches, before anything else.\nFirst we need to create the foundation (git init) for our building (our project/source code).\nWhat init will do ? You may ask, well, it creates a folder with a bunch of cool things inside.\n\nI have added some stuff that are not populated from a fresh git init for educational reasons, for more information, check gitrepository-layout.\nOk, looks complicated right ? It may, but it's not. If you are not aware, git description is: \"the stupid content tracker\",\nI believe that may be a weird thing to describe our magical tool with such words, I prefer to say: \"the simple content tracker\", and will explain why.\nCreate and add a file\nLet's populate our repository and create a simple commit:\n\nCreate a file: touch README.md\nLet put something inside to make it more funny.\n\ncat README.md\n\n\n\nNow our working directory is not empty, we have something there! But sadly, not tracked by git, we can change that.\n\n\nAdd this files to be tracked by git, or indexed: git add README.md\nWait a minute, we did something with git right ? Let's see what changed:\n\n\nIndex\nThis file is just a binary glob with a bunch of basic information about the files and paths that git is tracking.\nWhat is important for us now, index will have the following content:\n\nA header for git internal usage.\nThe number of indexes (hashes) available.\nA list of hashes that contain:\n\nThe filename\nThe path\nThe time that the file was changed\nType of the file (can be a folder, or a virtual file and etc)\nThe permission of such file (linux permission)\nFile size\nAnd finally, our hash (sha1) [10ddd6d257e01349d514541981aeecea6b2e741d]\n\n\n\nWait, don't you believe me ? Check it here:\n\nCheck 0x000032 until 0x000046, you'll see our sha1 value 10ddd6d257e01349d514541981aeecea6b2e741d (0x10 0xdd 0xd6 0xd2) and after that our file README.md.\nIf you want to learn how it works and what is inside, check here for more information,\nand here for an awesome adventure.\nObjects\nOk, now that we know that index is pointing to this hash, let's check the objects folder.\nAs I said before, objects folder will store all the references that exist, it should be our yellow pages. First, let's understand how to read it.\nThere is a folder called 10, and after that a file that has the name of ddd6d257e01349d514541981aeecea6b2e741d, if you put both together you are going to end up with our hash that we found in the index file.\nJust for our curiosity, this hash is calculated based in the following format {TYPE} {SIZE}{NULL_CHAR}{CONTENT}, the type will tell git if the hash points to a tree or a blob, the tree can have multiple blobs (like a folder), and a blob is a file. In our case, the string that defines this hash is the following:\n\nFor more information, check Git Internals Git Objects, it's a great friday night reading.\nOk! Now we are ready to commit!\nHey, wait, what is inside of this files object files ?\nOh my, ok, for now, this is where the git magic happens, it's a binary object that contains information about the diff, don't bother about it, but if you are really willing to know, check it here (Please open an issue if you know a better and friendly reference).\nBack to the commit!\nCommit\n\ngit commit -sm \"First commit\"\n\n\nOk, we have finished our first commit and now we have two more objects, let's check what is inside of each one:\n\nAs you can see, we have a commit object: 1d12099363e995c9fc3e1d2cc68b74b8e10c361a, that points to the tree 08f87015745258743015340c5466fe69c94f7587,\nthis tree has a single file on it, our old friendly README.md, and this same tree says that this blob has the hash 10ddd6d257e01349d514541981aeecea6b2e741d, and this hash contains the content of README.md. Simple Right ?!\nAs I said, a tree can contain multiple blobs, or more trees, like in the following example:\n\n  \n  \n    \"Git Internals Git Objects\" from Git SCM is licensed under CC BY 3.0\n  \n\nAnd after some more commits, we end up with multiple commits, that each commit has a tree, and each tree points to more trees or more blobs!\n\n  \n  \n    \"Git Internals Git Objects\" from Git SCM is licensed under CC BY 3.0\n  \nWrap up git commit logic and git internals\nGit, as a simple content tracker, uses a simple logic to manage all the files, as you saw, git works with the filesystem as a dictionary, where the filenames define the key and the content of such files are the content of this dictionary key, you can think about it as a content-addressable filesystem.\nSince we have finished talking about git manages our commits, files and everything else, let us finish this deep introductory part with how the commit and the object creation works.\n\n  \n  \n    \"Reset workflow\" from Git SCM is licensed under CC BY 3.0\n  \n\nThe previous is a good simple example of how a commit works, first we have a untracked file in our working directory, we stage this file (git add) and after that we commit this file (git commit) the commit does update the HEAD (the hash where we are right now). And doing a checkout to a different hash (or HEAD) will result in a change of the working directory to match what was commited.\nCool extensions to have:\n\ndelta: A syntax-highlighting pager for git, diff, and grep output\ngit-absorb: git commit --fixup, but automatic\n\nReferences\nCheck the official Git SCM website and repository for images and guidance.'\n","id":"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/how-to-rock-flowing-with-git/","title":"How to rock: Flowing with git"},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/qmlonline-a-new-home/":{"body":"A quick update, QML Online now has a new home!\n\nWebsite: qmlonline.kde.org\nRepository: invent.kde.org/webapps/qmlonline\n\nWhat is next\nNow that the project is under KDE organization, I'll start with the planned new capabilities, such as the Kirigami support and the html element to help with online documentation of qml snippets.\nAnd to finish this quick update, be invited to help with the project and send Merge Requests, feature requests and opinions.\n\n","id":"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/qmlonline-a-new-home/","title":"QML Online - A new home!"},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/qmlonline-can-be-everywhere/":{"body":"A new feature of QML Online is already available, allows it to run in any site/blog with minimal js/html code!\nHopefully, our experience with QML examples, tutorials and documentation should change in the near future.\n\nFf you don't know what QML Online is, please take a look in my previous posts:\n\nQML Online - First version\nQML Online - QML Online - A new home!\n\nWhat are we talking about ?\nQML Online now can be used in any blog or website without much work, like this:\n\n\n```js\nimport QtQuick 2.7\nimport QtQuick.Controls 2.3\nimport QtQuick.Layouts 1.12\n\nRectangle {\n    color: \"#179AF3\"\n    anchors.fill: parent\n\n     ColumnLayout{\n        anchors.bottom: parent.bottom\n        anchors.right: parent.right\n        CheckBox {\n            checked: true\n            text: \"Check this!\"\n        }\n        CheckBox {\n            text: \"Or this!\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    Text {\n        text: \"KDE\"\n        font.pixelSize: 80\n        font.bold: true\n        color: \"#82CB38\"\n        anchors.centerIn: parent\n        RotationAnimator on rotation {\n            running: true\n            loops: Animation.Infinite\n            from: 0\n            to: 360\n            duration: 1500\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd how can this new feature be used ?\nIt's quite simple, check this minimal HTML example:\n\nAs you can see, there is three steps, include both qtloader.js and qml.js, add a div DOM and create a QmlOnline object.\nSince I'm not a web expert, probably there is a better way to organize this approach for the user and bugs may exist.\nBe free to create Merge Requests, or get in touch with feature requests and issues.\nWhat is next ?\nFrom my planned objectives, sharing QML Online as library to be available for any website was one of the final points, the only one that's still missing is the Kirigami support, that's still in progress and hopefully will be finished until the end of the year (if everything goes fine).\nThere is also a small bug, where it's not possible to use multiple QML Online instances on the same webpage.\n","id":"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/qmlonline-can-be-everywhere/","title":"QML Online - Can be everywhere!"},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/qmlonline-first-version/":{"body":"Finally, after working since October and learning a bunch about WebAssembly, CSS, HTML (sad, right ?) and emscripten, I can happily announce a stable version of qmlonline!\nIn this post, I'm going to show the idea behind the project and some code that may help you with your future adventures.\nThe initial steps\nEverything starts with QHot, that I describe as \"Hot reload for nested QML files\", a useful tool for anyone that likes to prototype UI elements or ideas with a real-time feedback of what you are typing in QML. I noticed that compiling the project or recalling qml/qmlscene tools just to test and check my ideas was pretty annoying and time-consuming, the desire to have something like godbolt or quick-bench started growing. My objective was something that was closer to these tools but for QML development, and that is how QHot was born.\n\nWith QHot working, I started to add some small features in the command line interface to have mostly of the functionalities that exist in qml/qmlscene, at least the most important ones for my use.\nAfter some days, the idea of QHot working in the browser via webassembly started to grow, and with that, the initial work that would result in qmlonline.\nJourney\nAfter some tweaks around QHot, it was possible to have the first version of qmlonline working.\nThe initial version was entirely made with QML, without HTML components, the editor was a TextEdit with a fancy QSyntaxHighlighter. The text inside the TextEdit was used to create a new component with Qt.createQmlObject.\n\nWith the initial version working, I started to move the interface to HTML, this was necessary to have a better shortcut handling system and a better integration with the browser for user inputs.\nThe code evolved from a simple TextEdit with some controls to a full HTML interface, for that, functions had to be imlpemented to help with the webassembly code to be accessible from the webpage.\nFrom the beginning, I had an initial singleton class called Util that was conceived to be some kind of helper class for the QML code. This same class was used to create the interface between the JS and the webassembly via emscripten.\nIn general, two functions were created, std::string Util::codeEMS() const that returns the code that is being used in the QML to render the user component, and void Util::setCodeEMS(const std::string&amp; code) that sets the code that should be rendered.\nTo access both functions and the class, EMSCRIPTEN_BINDINGS were used.\n\nThat's probably the most important piece of code to do the integration between the C++ and JS.\nAnd for the QML, well, you can check all QML here:\n\nOh, you can check the source code here.\nTo build the project, I changed my approach a couple of times.\nFor the first test version, I did my development based in the official documents for Qt webassembly. But, compiling Qt for each machine that I use was a bit of a pain, so I started to use a docker available from this Qt blog post.\nAnd everything was great until newer versions of Qt and emscript were released, and after some time searching, I found this great repository/developer with a couple of Qt containers for webassembly and different emscript versions.\nAnd after building the project, you can always test it with python3 -m http.server.\nWhere I am\n\nAs you can see from the gif, the basic functionality is still the same from the original version, that was full QML.\nThe user experience has improved, the interface is now much smoother compared to the full QML version. Qt webassembly is great, but from my tests, the performance was not good and the browser/system integration needs improvement to have the same functionality as a normal webpage or application.\nAgain, remember to check qmlonline in your browser :)\nIf you have good QML examples and wish to add those, contact me via email, or create an issue in the repository, or send a PR, it's really simple.\nWhat I'm working on\nThere is a couple of things that I'm still working to improve qmlonline:\n\nKirigami support\nBetter ace editor integration with QML\nA qmlonline element to integrate with websites like Qt/KDE website documents\nStart to move qmlonline to be a KDE project\n\nAny feature request will be much welcome!\nThanks!\nSpecial thanks to Arthur Turrini, everybody in Qt Brasil telegram channel and the KDE members, the project would not be possible without the help and inspiration provided by the developers.\n","id":"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/qmlonline-first-version/","title":"QML Online - First stable version!"},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/qmlonline-qt515-kirigami-and-more/":{"body":"I'm happy to announce that QML Online  is now running with the last version of Qt (5.15) and with an initial Kirigami integration with breeze icons!\n\n\nThere is also a couple of updates for quality of life, like:\n\nHTML fixes/corrections\nBetter integration with Firefox\nNew Qt version information label\nSupport for QtQuick.XmlListModel\n\nBut sadly, with new features we do have new bugs! As I said before, the Kirigami integration is an initial version, there are some know bugs with it, like:\n\nOverlayDrawer has a transparent background (the issue appears to be common in low performance environments)\nKirigami version is a bit old (v5.70), newer versions need Qt future feature for QFuture and friends\n\nWhat is next\nI'll be working closer with Kirigami to fix these bugs, and the new feature of multiple instances of QML Online on the same webpage will be in hold for now.\nAs a reminder, please be free to send Merge Requests, feature requests, opinions and issues.\nThanks\nI would like to thank all users of QML Online, and the people that are sending kind works about how it's improving their workflow and how useful the tool is!

It might be useful to you, and by saying you, I'm also considering my own future variations.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not a health professional or anyone that should be followed or hear about health or physical activities, this is just my own research and conclusions based on everything that I have supposed learned.\n\nLoosing weight, in a good way\nWell, the most important thing to know is: Diet.\nExercises will help you maintain muscles, better cardiac and respiratory condition. But they are not the main point when losing weight, diet is. This is mostly pointed out by Muzy, Barakat, Balestrin, and many others, where a caloric deficit is required.\nJessie Inchauspé advocates for the usage of modern glucose tactics to decrease the amount of energy used or stored by your cells when glucose is available in the system through insulin. Insulin is a hormone produced by your pancreas that helps regulate blood sugar (glucose) levels. When you eat, especially carbohydrates, your blood sugar rises, triggering the release of insulin. Insulin helps your cells absorb this glucose for energy or store it for later use (fat). You can help your body use the energy available in the cells by drinking water and staying hydrated. That's one of the reasons people use creatine.\nJessie provides 10 rules to help people have better glucose control:\n\nEat in Order: Consume your food in a specific order to flatten glucose curves: start with vegetables, then protein and fats, and finish with starches (carbohydrates) and sugars.\n\nYou can also take advantage of this mechanism by doing combinations. If you are eating pasta, try to add minced meat. If you are eating protein, try to add a salad.\n\n\nVinegar Power: Add a tablespoon or two of vinegar (like apple cider vinegar) to meals or have it as a drink before eating to help reduce glucose spikes (20min).\nPost-Meal Walks: Exercise, take a walk after meals to help your body use the glucose from the food you've eaten.\nProtein with Everything: Include a source of protein in each meal and snack to slow down the absorption of carbohydrates. The best thing to eat in the morning are salt foods with high protein.\nBeware of \"Healthy\" Foods: Be mindful that even seemingly healthy foods like fruit juices, smoothies, and certain fruits can cause significant glucose spikes. Eat the entire fruit, do not blende it. Your body DOES NOT CARE, if the sugar comes from a fruit or a coke. At least the fruit comes with fibers that help decreasing the glucose absorption.\nSnack Smart: If you snack, pair carbohydrates with protein and fats (e.g., apple slices with nut butter) to mitigate sugar spikes.\nWhole Fruit Focus: Opt for whole fruits over fruit juices, as the fiber in whole fruits helps moderate glucose response.\nSleep Matters: Prioritize good sleep hygiene, as sleep deprivation can disrupt glucose metabolism. This is also super important for muscle growth.\nStress Management: Find healthy ways to manage stress, as chronic stress can negatively impact blood sugar levels.\nFiber is Your Friend: Include plenty of fiber-rich foods in your diet to support gut health and slow down the absorption of sugar.\n\nWhile doing diet, it's also important to do exercises to avoid loosing muscles.\n\nDid you know that diabetes type 3 is a way to describe alzheimer ? And that glucose is directly related to aging ? Yeah, do some research about that (check the references as well).\n\nLoosing fat\nWhile doing exercises, it's important to keep in mind the \"fat burn zone,\" which is between 50 to 70% of your maximum heart rate. Some sources on the internet suggest using \"220 - your age\" to estimate your maximum rate. So, for me, (220 - 32) * (0.5 to 0.7) = [94 to 131]; that's the rate at which I should keep my heartbeat to encourage my body to burn fat. Going over this zone, humorously called the cardio zone, might lead your body to start burning muscles over fat since it's quicker and easier. When running and exercising, it sometimes takes around 20min+ for your body to start burning fat; you should feel more energetic, and the exercise feels easier. At that point, you should control yourself to keep your heartbeat within the zone.\nMuzy notes that cardio exercises yield the best results after a long time, around 9 months to a year, as your body undergoes an adaptation phase. It certainly helps with weight loss, but that includes muscle mass. I would recommend avoiding this, but there is no consensus on this information.\nAn important point, if you are just starting, it might be worthwhile to gain some weight through muscle mass by focusing on hypertrophy training to increase muscle, thereby boosting your metabolism and energy consumption. After that, you can start dieting and cardio exercises.\nGaining muscle\n03, Food please\nWell, the most important thing to know is: Diet.\n... And heavy weight exercises!\nWhat is the role of diet ? Protein intake. The rule of thumb is to consume \"(1.6 to 2.2) * your weight in kg\".\n\nMost studies have looked at dosages up to 1.5 g/kg; only a few have looked at dosages as high as 2.2–3.3 g/kg. However, in healthy people, even those higher dosages don’t seem to have negative effects. (From Examine)\n\nIt appears that \"cannot be excluded that carbohydrate addition may provide benefits for recovering athletes, on the basis of available data, no further beneficial actions of carbohydrates, irrespective of GI, are evident concerning muscle hypertrophy when a protein supplement that maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis is ingested. (Vandré/David)\" about carbohydrate intake with protein to hypertrophy.\nBut.. \"In summary, ingestion of carbohydrate + protein (or amino acids) in close temporal proximity to or throughout both endurance and resistance exercise may operate as an effective strategy to favorably affect performance of a subsequent exercise bout as well as adaptations from regular bouts of training. Towards this end, enhancements in endurance performance, as well as improved recovery of reduced muscle glycogen have also been consistently reported when carbohydrate + protein combinations have been consumed surrounding exercise bouts, particularly if lower quantities of carbohydrate are consumed. However, when optimal carbohydrate is delivered the impact of adding protein (irrespective of when it is provided) appears to offer little to no additional benefit on endurance or resistance exercise performance as well as the recovery of reduced muscle glycogen. (Chad/Shawn/Brad/...)\". The paper also points to an intake of  3:1 / 4:1 (carbohydrate to protein) in daily bases. The final conclusion is that carbohydrate intake does not have a clear directly role for muscle protein synthesis, but it indirectly helps. There are no conclusion on the area.\nSo.. protein intake, protein is necessary.\n\nNow.. we know the amount of protein intake, now.. what is the frequency ?\nThe last cited paper says that protein intake should be every 3 hours, divided equally during the day. But others sources points to 4 hours (4 times during the day). This approach is to optimize your protein intake during the day to take better advantage of your body muscle synthesis, that operates constantly over the day. Since you'll not store protein to build muscle, providing a constant source of protein will be more effective with body.\nAlcohol\nIf you like to drink, keep in mind that alcohol consumption leads to muscle weakness and atrophy in part by suppressing protein synthesis (Indirectly). It increases the resistance to peripheral insulin, reducing muscle growth, disrupting the energy absorption by cells, resulting in this available energy into fat. The carbs in a beer, are available in liquid form, making it really quick for the body to absorb, as consequence, you'll probably not going to use this total available energy, resulting on the storage of it as well (and there is also the glucose spike as well).\nGrowing\nFirst, lets define some stuff:\n\nTempo: The time during a single action, can be described in two sets of times, one for contraction and the other for relaxation.\n\nBy Brad, Dan and James, the results indicate that hypertrophic outcomes are similar when training with repetition durations ranging from 0.5 to 8 s.\n\n\nReps: The amount of times you perform an action in a single set, usually with the same tempo during each action. E.g: 10 burpees in a single set.\n\nFor strength 1-6 reps, for muscle size 6-12 reps, and for resistances 12+ reps.\n\n\nRest: Time between each set. Longer times usually help with hypertrophy and smaller times with endurance.\n\nFor hypertrophy it's recommended a time between 1m30s and 2m of resting between sets. Less than that for endurance.\n\n\nSets: Number of times you perform a number of repetitions, usually with a equally rest time between sets. E.g: 3 sets of 10 burpees with a rest time of 2min between sets.\n\nThere are a couple of tactics that takes sets and reps counts that we'll explore later.\n\n\nFailure: The point where a repetition can't be done.\n\nThere are a couple of tactics that are based on failure.\n\n\nProtocol: The union of weight, sets and reps.\nVolume: We can define it as weight * sets * reps.\n\nNow, lets explore the following scenario: You are someone that wants to do a hypertrophy training.\n\nSets the weight in a way that you can perform 4 sets of 12 reps where in the final rep of the final set you hit failure.\nPerform 12 reps until you hit failure, decrease the weight in 20%, repeat until failure and do it again 3 times, this represents a set, you can do 3 sets like that.\nPerform 12 reps until you hit failure on your first set, rest, increase the weight in 10% and repeat until failure, rest, and repeat until you hit 4 reps.\n(The one that I do) Perform 12 reps of weight X in the first set, do X * 1.2 on the second set, add X * 1.2² on the third set. Take note and do that until you can perform 12 reps of X * 1.2 on your second set, if you can do it, this new value will be your new X.\n\nWhile changing between protocols, be sure to set the volume the same as the previous one. By changing weight, sets and reps but making it still inside the defined ranges.\nMath, recording, keeping control over your training is important! Create notes about your weights, sets and reps.\n\n  \n  \n    \"Edited by me, created with ChatGPT\"\n  \n\nA final note, resting is equally important, take your time, try to avoid repeating exercises in less than 48 hours. Sleep well.\nWhile doing your training, try to schedule it as:\nDayMondayTuesdayWednesdayThursdayFridaySaturdaySundayMonday...\nSchedule 1ABABAB...\nSchedule 2ABCABC...\n\nYou can also split your daily protocol (legs, chest, arms) to be divided by two during the day, doing half of A during lunch break and the other parts during dinner.\nReferences\n\nTarget Heart Rate and Estimated Maximum Heart Rate - CDC\nHow Your Blood Sugar Impacts Wrinkles, Weight, And Overall Aging By Poosh\nThe Interrelationship between Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1, Apolipoprotein E ε4, Lifestyle Factors, and the Aging Body and Brain - Sara A.

The more concrete, the better.\n\n\n\nAdvanced techniques\n\nChain of Thought (COT)\n\nAsk the model to show its reasoning steps before writing the final answer.\n\n\nTree of Thought (TOT)\n\nRequest multiple solution options, then ask for a synthesis or best-of.\n\n\nBattle of the bots (adversarial validation)\n\nSet up competing personas and add a \"critic\" to help validate or improve outputs.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nThe Ultimate Guide to AI Prompting\n\nWhat should you do now ?\nMaybe using AI to create the prompt for you is the best thing to do :)\nFor that, use the following text as an instruction for llms to write the prompt for you:\n(Think of it as a blog inside of a blog)\n\n","id":"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2025/ultimate-guide-to-creating-better-ai-prompts/","title":"The Ultimate Guide to Creating Better AI Prompts"}},"docInfo":{"https://patrickelectric.work/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2016/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2016/fm-demodulation/":{"body":389,"title":3},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2016/ftdi-problem-pid-0000/":{"body":90,"title":4},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2016/starting-with-intel-edison-platform/":{"body":159,"title":4},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2016/the-real-tutorial-for-galileo-gen-2-board/":{"body":155,"title":6},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2017/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2017/graber-i3-tutorial-finished/":{"body":339,"title":4},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2017/kdev-embedded-debugging-and-programming-embedded-systems/":{"body":199,"title":7},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2017/kdev-embedded-openocd-and-avrdude/":{"body":84,"title":5},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2017/kdev-embedded-the-alpha-version-is-coming/":{"body":43,"title":6},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2017/kdev-embedded-workflow-integration/":{"body":141,"title":5},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2017/lakademy2017/":{"body":157,"title":2},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2017/qt3d-lines-atcore/":{"body":116,"title":3},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2018/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2018/ch341a-dongle/":{"body":393,"title":9},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2018/raspberry-mult-boot/":{"body":211,"title":5},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2018/streaming-with-gstreamer/":{"body":346,"title":2},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/how-to-rock-contribution-tips/":{"body":401,"title":4},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/how-to-rock-first-tips/":{"body":758,"title":3},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/how-to-rock-flowing-with-git/":{"body":889,"title":3},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/qmlonline-a-new-home/":{"body":44,"title":4},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/qmlonline-can-be-everywhere/":{"body":181,"title":3},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/qmlonline-first-version/":{"body":403,"title":5},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/qmlonline-qt515-kirigami-and-more/":{"body":112,"title":7},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2024/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2024/harder-better-faster-stronger/":{"body":1466,"title":4},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2025/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2025/ultimate-guide-to-creating-better-ai-prompts/":{"body":185,"title":6}},"length":31},"lang":"English"}
