It contains information abut good code practices, a simple guide of helpful API design, code organization, comments, naming variables, development flow and self-criticism. Please enjoy, and any feedback (including critics) is much appreciated!\nCode practices\n\n\nEncapsulate magic variables:\n...// First version\n  start_communication(0, 1, 232);\n  // Reviewer: What is the meaning of 0 ? What is 1 ? Why 232 ?\n\n...// Second version\n  enum class Messages {\n      ...\n      RequestStatus = 232,\n  }\n  ...\n  const uint8_t vid = 0;\n  const uint8_t cid = 1;\n  start_communication(vid, cid, Messages::RequestStatus);\n  // Reviewer: What is vid ? What is cid ?\n\n...//Final version\n  ...\n  const uint8_t vehicle_id = 0;\n  const uint8_t component_id = 1;\n  start_communication(vehicle_id, component_id, Messages::RequestStatus);\n\nAs you can see, the final version makes everything more readable, we know that we are starting the communication with a vehicle that has an id of 0 and the vehicle probably contains a component with id 1, and while calling this function we are also requesting the status. Much better than 0, 1 and 232 right ?\nDoing this will help the reviewers and future developers to understand what is the meaning of such numbers.\nIt's also necessary to avoid variables that contains only single letters or really short abbreviations, is much harder to understand this: $$C^2 = A^2 + B^2$$\nover this: $$hypotenuse^2 = catheti_1^2 + catheti_2^2$$\n\n\nAvoid multiple arguments:\n...// First version\nauto vehicle = new Vehicle(\n    VehicleType::Car,\n    4,\n    {28, 31},\n    Fuel::Electric,\n    1.2,\n    613\n);\n// Reviewer: What is the meaning of all this values ?\n//           How can we make it better ?\n\n...// Second version\nauto vehicle = new Vehicle(VehicleType::Car)\nvehicle-&gt;setNumberOfTires(4);\nvehicle-&gt;setTirePressure({28, 31});\nvehicle-&gt;setFuel(Fuel::Electric);\nvehicle-&gt;setWeightInTons(1.2);\nvehicle-&gt;setAutonomyInKm(613);\n\n...// It's also possible to use aggregate initialization in C++20\n// and user-defined literals from C++11\nauto vehicle = new Vehicle({\n    .type = VehicleType::Car,\n    .numberOfTires = 4,\n    .tirePressure = {28_psi, 31_psi},\n    .fuel = Fuel::Electric,\n    .weight = 1.2_tn,\n    .autonomy = 613_km,\n});\n\nBoth second and C++20/C++11 alternatives are valid for a better readability of the code, to choose between both alternatives will depend of how are you going to design your API, probably if you are more familiar with the Qt API, the second version appears to be the most common, the C++20/C++11 alternative appears to be a bit more verbose but can be useful to avoid multiple function calls and helpful when dealing with a simpler code base.\n\n\nEncapsulate code when necessary, try to break functions in a more readable and explanatory way:\n...// Original version\nvoid Serial::start_serial_communication() {\n    // Check if we are open to talk\n    if (!_port || _port-&gt;register() != 0xb0001) {\n        log(\"Serial port is not open!\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Send a 10ms serial break signal\n    _port-&gt;set_break_enabled(true);\n    msleep(10);\n    _port-&gt;set_break_enabled(false);\n    usleep(10);\n    // Send intercalated binary for detection\n    _port-&gt;write('U');\n    _port-&gt;flush();\n\n    // Send start AT command\n    _port-&gt;write(\"AT+start\");\n}\n\n// Reviewer: Try to make it more readable encapsulating\n//            some functionalities\n\n...// Second version\nbool Serial::is_port_open() {\n    return !_port || _port-&gt;register() != 0xb0001;\n}\n\nvoid Serial::force_baudrate_detection() {\n    // Send a 10ms serial break signal\n    _port-&gt;set_break_enabled(true);\n    msleep(10);\n    _port-&gt;set_break_enabled(false);\n    usleep(10);\n    // Send intercalated binary for detection\n    _port-&gt;write('U');\n    _port-&gt;flush();\n}\n\nvoid Serial::send_message(Message message_type) {\n    _port-&gt;write(messageFromType(message_type));\n}\n\nvoid Serial::start_serial_communication() {\n    if (!is_port_open()) {\n        log(\"Serial port is not open!\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    force_baudrate_detection();\n    send_message(Message::Start)\n}\n\nAs you can see, the reason behind each block of code is clear now, and with that, the comments are also not necessary anymore, the code is friendly and readable enough that's possible to understand it without any comments, the function name does the job for free.\n\n\nAvoid comments, that's a clickbait, comments are really necessary, but they may be unnecessary when you are doing something that's really straightforward, and sometimes when something isn't, it's better to encapsulate it.\n    ...// Original version\n    void blink_routine() {\n        // Use the LED builtin\n        const int led_builtin = LED_BUILTIN;\n        // Configure ping to output\n        setPinAsOutput(led_builtin);\n\n        // Loop forever\n        while(true) {\n            // Turn the LED on\n            turnPinOn(led_builtin);\n            // Wait for a second\n            wait_seconds(1);\n            // Turn the LED off\n            turnPinOff(led_builtin);\n            // Wait for a second\n            wait_seconds(1);\n        }\n    }\n\nBefore checking the final version, let me talk more about it:\n\n\nFor each line of code you'll have a comment (like a parrot that repeat what we say), and the worst thing about these comments is that the content is exactly what you can read from the code! You can think that this kind of comment is dead code, something that has the same meaning as the code, but it does not run, resulting in a duplicated amount of lines to maintain. If you forget to update each comment for each line of code, you'll have a comment that does not match with the code, and this will be pretty confuse for someone that's reading it.\n\n\nOne of the most important skills about writing comments, is to know when not to write it!\n\n\nA comment should bring a value to the code, if you can remove the comment and the code can be understandable by a newcomer, the comment is not important.\n\n\n...// Final version\n    void blink_routine() {\n        const int led_builtin = LED_BUILTIN;\n        setPinAsOutput(led_builtin);\n\n        while(true) {\n            turnPinOn(led_builtin);\n            wait_seconds(1);\n            turnPinOff(led_builtin);\n            wait_seconds(1);\n        }\n    }\n\nThere is a good video about this subject by Walter E. Brown in cppcon 2017, \"Whitespace ≤ Comments ＜＜ Code\".\nAnd to finish, you should not avoid comments, you should understand when comments are necessary, like this:\n// From ArduPilot - GPIO_RPI\nvoid set_gpio_mode_alt(int pin, int alternative) {\n    // **Moved content from cpp for this example**\n    const uint8_t pins_per_register = 10;\n    // Calculates the position of the 3 bit mask in the 32 bits register\n    const uint8_t tree_bits_position_in_register = (pin%pins_per_register)*3;\n    /** Creates a mask to enable the alternative function based in the following logic:\n    *\n    * | Alternative Function | 3 bits value |\n    * |:--------------------:|:------------:|\n    * |      Function 0      |     0b100    |\n    * |      Function 1      |     0b101    |\n    * |      Function 2      |     0b110    |\n    * |      Function 3      |     0b111    |\n    * |      Function 4      |     0b011    |\n    * |      Function 5      |     0b010    |\n    */\n    const uint8_t alternative_value =\n        (alternative &lt; 4 ? (alternative + 4) : (alternative == 4 ? 3 : 2));\n    // 0b00'000'000'000'000'000'000'ALT'000'000'000 enables alternative for the 4th pin\n    const uint32_t mask_with_alt = static_cast&lt;uint32_t&gt;(alternative_value) &lt;&lt; tree_bits_position_in_register;\n    const uint32_t mask = 0b111 &lt;&lt; tree_bits_position_in_register;\n    // Clear all bits in our position and apply our mask with alt values\n    uint32_t register_value = _gpio[pin / pins_per_register];\n    register_value &amp;= ~mask;\n    _gpio[pin / pins_per_register] = register_value | mask_with_alt;\n}\n\nMostly of the lines in this code can be impossible to understand without access or reading the datasheet directly,\nthe comments are here to understand what is going on and why, otherwise anyone that'll touch this code will need to do a reverse engineer to understand it.\n\n\nDevelopment flow\n\n\nAvoid creating multiple Pull Requests (PRs), update the ones that are still open.\n\nE.g: You created a Pull Request called \"Add button feature\", some modifications will be necessary after the review process, and for that you'll need to update the same branch over creating new ones. That's necessary to help the project maintainers to see previous comments and the development history. Creating multiple PRs will only make the maintainers confuse and unable to track old comments, suggestions and your code changes between PRs.\n\n\n\nCreate atomic and self-contained commits, avoid doing multiple tasks in the same commit.\n\n\nE.g: You created a commit to fix the serial communication class, and inside the same commit you are doing 3 different tasks, removing trailing spaces, fixing a pointer validation check and a typo in the documentation of a different class. This appear to be silly and bureaucratic, but there are good reasons to break this simple commit and at least 3 different commits, one for the pointer check, a second one for the typo and a third one for the trailing space.\nDevelopers usually track lines history to understand the changes behind a functionality, it's common to search with grep history from commits or line changes in specific commits to understand the history of a library, function, class, or a small feature, if the commits start to be polluted with unnecessary changes, this development practice will be almost impossible to be done, since a bunch of unrelated lines will me changed between commits and this technic will be unable to help the dear developer. git blame will also be of little help.\nThe example was also really simple, but you can imagine what happens if you change different parts of the code, for unrelated things, and a bug appears, technics such as git bisect will still work, but the result will be much harder to understand and to find which line is the one that created such bug.\n\n\n\n\nCreate atomic and self-sustained PRs, avoid doing multiple things in the same PR, like different features. They may appear simple with small pieces of code/functionality but they can escalate quickly after a review process, and if both features are somehow related or dependently, it's recommended to break it in multiple PRs with code to maintain compatibility with current code base.\n\nE.g: You have applied a PR for software notifications, and somehow you also added a URL fetch functionality to grab new software versions from the server. After the first review, the maintainer asks to create a more abstracted way to fetch data from a REST API and to deal with network requirements, this will start to convolute the PR, moving the initial idea of the notification feature to an entire network REST API architecture. With that, it's better to break the PR in two, one that only provides the notification and a second PR that is used for the REST API related code.\n\n\n\nDo your own review, the final and probably most important tip of all, doing that will train your mind and eyes to detect poor code standards or bad practices, it'll also make your PR be merged easily and faster, since you'll be able to catch problems before the reviewer feedback. Some reviewers may think that reviewing your own PR is a must, since we are talking about open source projects and free software, you should understand that the people that are reviewing your code are not obligated to do so, the majority are collaborating and donating their own time to help the development and maintenance of such projects, doing your own review is a sign of empathy about the project and maintainer time.\n\n\nFinal comment\nThis is the first post of a series that I'm planning to do. Hope that some of these points may help you in your journey.\nReferences\n\nCppCon 2019: Kate Gregory “Naming is Hard: Let's Do Better”\nCppCon 2018: Kate Gregory “Simplicity: Not Just For Beginners”\nCppCon 2018: Kate Gregory “What Do We Mean When We Say Nothing At All?”\nCppCon 2017: Lars Knoll “Qt as a C++ Framework: History, Present State and Future”\nCppCon 2017: Kate Gregory “10 Core Guidelines You Need to Start Using Now”\nAPI Design Principles - TQtC\nDesigning Qt-Style C++ APIs - Matthias Ettrich\nThe Little Manual of API Design - Jasmin Blanchette\n\n","id":"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/how-to-rock-first-tips/","title":"How to rock: First tips"},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/qmlonline-a-new-home/":{"body":"A quick update, QML Online now has a new home!\n\nWebsite: qmlonline.kde.org\nRepository: invent.kde.org/webapps/qmlonline\n\nWhat is next\nNow that the project is under KDE organization, I'll start with the planned new capabilities, such as the Kirigami support and the html element to help with online documentation of qml snippets.\nAnd to finish this quick update, be invited to help with the project and send Merge Requests, feature requests and opinions.\n\n","id":"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/qmlonline-a-new-home/","title":"QML Online - A new home!"},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/qmlonline-can-be-everywhere/":{"body":"A new feature of QML Online is already available, allows it to run in any site/blog with minimal js/html code!\nHopefully, our experience with QML examples, tutorials and documentation should change in the near future.\n\nFf you don't know what QML Online is, please take a look in my previous posts:\n\nQML Online - First version\nQML Online - QML Online - A new home!\n\nWhat are we talking about ?\nQML Online now can be used in any blog or website without much work, like this:\n\n\nimport QtQuick 2.7\nimport QtQuick.Controls 2.3\nimport QtQuick.Layouts 1.12\nRectangle {\n    color: \"#179AF3\"\n    anchors.fill: parent\n     ColumnLayout{\n        anchors.bottom: parent.bottom\n        anchors.right: parent.right\n        CheckBox {\n            checked: true\n            text: \"Check this!\"\n        }\n        CheckBox {\n            text: \"Or this!\"\n        }\n    }\n    Text {\n        text: \"KDE\"\n        font.pixelSize: 80\n        font.bold: true\n        color: \"#82CB38\"\n        anchors.centerIn: parent\n        RotationAnimator on rotation {\n            running: true\n            loops: Animation.Infinite\n            from: 0\n            to: 360\n            duration: 1500\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nAnd how can this new feature be used ?\nIt's quite simple, check this minimal HTML example:\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Qml Online minimal example&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://qmlonline.kde.org/qtloader.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://qmlonline.kde.org/qml.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n    &lt;div id=\"qmlonline\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;script type='text/qml'&gt;\n    import QtQuick 2.7\n    import QtQuick.Controls 2.3\n    Rectangle {\n        color: \"#179AF3\"\n        anchors.fill: parent\n        Text {\n            text: \"KDE\"\n            font.pixelSize: 80\n            font.bold: true\n            color: \"#82CB38\"\n            anchors.centerIn: parent\n            RotationAnimator on rotation {\n                running: true\n                loops: Animation.Infinite\n                from: 0\n                to: 360\n                duration: 1500\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n\n    &lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;\n        const qml = new QmlOnline(\"qmlonline\")\n        qml.registerCall({\n            qmlMessage: function(msg) {\n                console.log(`qml message: ${msg}`)\n            },\n            qmlError: function(data) {\n                console.log(`qml error: ${JSON.stringify(data)}`)\n            },\n            posInit: function() {\n                qml.setCode(Array.prototype.slice.apply(document.getElementsByTagName('script')).find(e =&gt;

I noticed that compiling the project or recalling qml/qmlscene tools just to test and check my ideas was pretty annoying and time-consuming, the desire to have something like godbolt or quick-bench started growing. My objective was something that was closer to these tools but for QML development, and that is how QHot was born.\n\nWith QHot working, I started to add some small features in the command line interface to have mostly of the functionalities that exist in qml/qmlscene, at least the most important ones for my use.\nAfter some days, the idea of QHot working in the browser via webassembly started to grow, and with that, the initial work that would result in qmlonline.\nJourney\nAfter some tweaks around QHot, it was possible to have the first version of qmlonline working.\nThe initial version was entirely made with QML, without HTML components, the editor was a TextEdit with a fancy QSyntaxHighlighter. The text inside the TextEdit was used to create a new component with Qt.createQmlObject.\n\nWith the initial version working, I started to move the interface to HTML, this was necessary to have a better shortcut handling system and a better integration with the browser for user inputs.\nThe code evolved from a simple TextEdit with some controls to a full HTML interface, for that, functions had to be imlpemented to help with the webassembly code to be accessible from the webpage.\nFrom the beginning, I had an initial singleton class called Util that was conceived to be some kind of helper class for the QML code. This same class was used to create the interface between the JS and the webassembly via emscripten.\nIn general, two functions were created, std::string Util::codeEMS() const that returns the code that is being used in the QML to render the user component, and void Util::setCodeEMS(const std::string&amp; code) that sets the code that should be rendered.\nTo access both functions and the class, EMSCRIPTEN_BINDINGS were used.\n#include &lt;emscripten/bind.h&gt;\n\nEMSCRIPTEN_BINDINGS(util) {\n    emscripten::class_&lt;Util&gt;(\"Util\")\n        .function(\"code\", &amp;Util::codeEMS)\n        .function(\"setCode\", &amp;Util::setCodeEMS);\n    emscripten::function(\"self\", &amp;Util::self, emscripten::allow_raw_pointers());\n}\n\nThat's probably the most important piece of code to do the integration between the C++ and JS.\nAnd for the QML, well, you can check all QML here:\n...\nimport Util 1.0\n\nApplicationWindow {\n    id: window\n    title: \"qmlonline\"\n    visible: true\n\n    Connections {\n        target: Util\n        onCodeChanged: userParentItem.create(Util.code)\n    }\n\n    Item {\n        id: userParentItem\n        anchors.fill: parent\n        property var userItem: null\n\n        function create(textComponent) {\n            if(userItem) {\n                userItem.destroy()\n            }\n            userItem = Qt.createQmlObject(textComponent, userParentItem, \"userItem\")\n        }\n\n        Component.onCompleted: userParentItem.create(Util.code)\n    }\n}\n\nOh, you can check the source code here.\nTo build the project, I changed my approach a couple of times.\nFor the first test version, I did my development based in the official documents for Qt webassembly. But, compiling Qt for each machine that I use was a bit of a pain, so I started to use a docker available from this Qt blog post.\nAnd everything was great until newer versions of Qt and emscript were released, and after some time searching, I found this great repository/developer with a couple of Qt containers for webassembly and different emscript versions.\nAnd after building the project, you can always test it with python3 -m http.server.\nWhere I am\n\nAs you can see from the gif, the basic functionality is still the same from the original version, that was full QML.\nThe user experience has improved, the interface is now much smoother compared to the full QML version. Qt webassembly is great, but from my tests, the performance was not good and the browser/system integration needs improvement to have the same functionality as a normal webpage or application.\nAgain, remember to check qmlonline in your browser :)\nIf you have good QML examples and wish to add those, contact me via email, or create an issue in the repository, or send a PR, it's really simple.\nWhat I'm working on\nThere is a couple of things that I'm still working to improve qmlonline:\n\nKirigami support\nBetter ace editor integration with QML\nA qmlonline element to integrate with websites like Qt/KDE website documents\nStart to move qmlonline to be a KDE project\n\nAny feature request will be much welcome!\nThanks!\nSpecial thanks to Arthur Turrini, everybody in Qt Brasil telegram channel and the KDE members, the project would not be possible without the help and inspiration provided by the developers.\n","id":"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/qmlonline-first-version/","title":"QML Online - First stable version!"}},"docInfo":{"https://patrickelectric.work/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2016/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2016/fm-demodulation/":{"body":617,"title":3},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2016/ftdi-problem-pid-0000/":{"body":115,"title":4},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2016/starting-with-intel-edison-platform/":{"body":194,"title":4},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2016/the-real-tutorial-for-galileo-gen-2-board/":{"body":163,"title":6},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2017/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2017/graber-i3-tutorial-finished/":{"body":339,"title":4},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2017/kdev-embedded-debugging-and-programming-embedded-systems/":{"body":199,"title":7},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2017/kdev-embedded-openocd-and-avrdude/":{"body":84,"title":5},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2017/kdev-embedded-the-alpha-version-is-coming/":{"body":43,"title":6},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2017/kdev-embedded-workflow-integration/":{"body":141,"title":5},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2017/lakademy2017/":{"body":157,"title":2},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2017/qt3d-lines-atcore/":{"body":216,"title":3},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2018/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2018/ch341a-dongle/":{"body":744,"title":9},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2018/raspberry-mult-boot/":{"body":238,"title":5},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2018/streaming-with-gstreamer/":{"body":1449,"title":2},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/how-to-rock-first-tips/":{"body":1095,"title":3},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/qmlonline-a-new-home/":{"body":44,"title":4},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/qmlonline-can-be-everywhere/":{"body":258,"title":3},"https://patrickelectric.work/blog/2020/qmlonline-first-version/":{"body":448,"title":5}},"length":24}};
