It was my first participation in a KDE sprint event, the famous LaKademy (Latin-America Akademy) in Brazil, Minas Gerais - Belo Horizonte. A great experience to talk, share and learn a bit more about KDE, coffee and software development.

Next I'll talk about some points of what I have done during the event.

# First day:

- AtCore:
  - Some bug corrections of the new AtCore test client, moving from QWidgets to QDockWidget.
  - Some patchs review.
  - .gitignore updates to remove .patch and .diff from project.
  - Update some tasks.
- KDevelop:
   - Solving compilation errors from `kdesrc-build --include-dependencies kdevelop`.
   - syntax-highlighting:
     - Add Arduino extensions (.ino, .pde).
   - Bug correction in breeze-icons, but one was already in review.

# Second day:

- babe-qt:
  - Code corrections and refactory.
  - Restore functionality of CMakeLists.
- KDevelop:
  - Solve some compile corrections.
  - Attempt to solve more compile problems with --include-dependencies.
- Atcore:
  - Adjustments in GUI.
  - Update in 3D visualizer of Gcode for 3D printers.

# Third day:

- KDE
  - Development of a docker to help the use and development of KDE applications with the help of `kdesrc-build`.
    - Tested with AtCore, Cantor, GCompris and Kate. ([Link](https://hub.docker.com/r/patrickelectric/kde/))
      - It was only possible with the help of Jedi.

# Last day:

- KDE
  - Finalization of kde's docker.
- KDevelop
  - Start to work in copy-paste functionality in KDevelop popup.

It was a event completely different of what I thought, a great experience for any developer. Maybe, next time, I can see you in LaKademy 2018 ;)
