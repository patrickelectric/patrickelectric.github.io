**3D printing**, also known as **additive manufacturing (AM)**, refers to various processes used to synthesize a [three-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space) object.<sup id="cite_ref-engineer_1-0" class="reference">[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing#cite_note-engineer-1)</sup> In 3D printing, successive layers of material are formed under computer control to create an object.

These objects can be of almost any shape or geometry, and are produced from a [3D model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_modeling "3D modeling") or other electronic data source. A 3D [printer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printer_(computing) "Printer (computing)") is a type of [industrial robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_robot "Industrial robot").

After this Wikipedia preview we can start work !

### Software

We need 3 kinds of software (ITS FREE):

1.  [The Slicer](http://slic3r.org/)
    *   Converts the model into a series of thin layers and produces a G-code file containing instructions tailored to a specific type of 3D printer. This G-code file can then be printed with 3D printing client software (which loads the G-code, and uses it to instruct the 3D printer during the 3D printing process).
2.  The graphical interface - [Pronterface](http://www.pronterface.com/) - [Repetier](http://www.repetier.com/)
    *   Interface to communicate and use the 3D printer.
3.  Firmware for RAMPS - [All of them ](http://reprap.org/wiki/Firmware) (I am using [Marlin](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin))
    *   Software to burn the Arduino Mega.

## <del>Where am I ?</del>

<del>Now I am making some moving testes of the axis, speed and acceleration. Until now everything is ok, just need to finish the extruder and start to print !</del>

## It's working !

After some time in Campinas-SP (Brazil) doing my internship on Intel, doing some cool stuffs, I am back to my city and my 3d printer .

Willian ([The guy with the cool blog in the top header](http://galvanicloop.com/)) was working with his own 3d printer and have done a extruder to me (You can see the photos below). After one day wiring the things and some tests, the printer is alive !

To make your printer a cool IoT device, add a respberry with Arch linus, wi-fi adapter and [Octoprint](http://octoprint.org/) to print and view the progress in your browser in computer or cellphone.
