A natureza humana é contraditória

I mean, that’s where your brain is — and your brain remembers, plans, makes judgements, solves problems … but you also remember and plan with things like these and this. And you solve problems and make judgements with all sorts of other stuff, too. The more you think about it, the more you realize that while the brain is a wet lump of fat and protein, no firmer than a glob of tofu, the MIND is something much larger: it’s an ever-expanding organ of tissue AND wood and stone and steel. And people. Because of communication we can even make OTHER PEOPLE extensions of our minds. We can access their memories and perceptions and knowledge by simply asking. Or not. I don’t need to learn how to fix a car AND practice medicine AND vulcanize rubber OR remember everything … other people are doing that for me just as I do things for them. We are a species of individuals that is also one big interdependent lumbering growth. A frantic blur of flesh and concrete. A ‘techno sapien’ powered by imaginations and passions made real by a hallowed faculty we call REASON.

Behavioral inertia is the tendency to keep doing what you’re already doing. Status quo bias. It can be a frustrating bias if you desire change, but its origin isn’t a flaw. If an organism has managed to survive long enough to reproduce and provide and care for its offspring, then the state of its world, was sufficient for its genes to spread. That’s all it takes to persist. The types of organisms we see around us will naturally be those that managed to persist and didn’t, after reaching the point at which they could persist, rock the boat too much. Behavioral inertia can help slow down the accumulation of unintended consequences and the loss of ideas that work, but it can also slow down innovation and adaptation. If the environmental impacts of our society were more immediate and un-ignorable, it wouldn’t be so tempting to apply this inertial brake. But emissions are invisible and their consequences aren’t immediate or local. They impact future people and people far away.

Information is unbreakable, but where it runs not.

It is easier to carry an empty cup than one that is filled to the brim. The sharper the knife the easier it is to dull. The more wealth you possess the harder it is to protect. Pride brings it’s own trouble. When you have accomplished your goal simply walk away. This is the pathway to Heaven.
Lao Tzu

Experiência é supervalorizada. Algumas pessoas dizem ter vinte anos de experiência, quando, na realidade, só têm um ano de experiência, repetido vinte vezes.

Todos tentamos fazer o nosso melhor num mundo onde é muito fácil fazer o pior

No technological change is only technological
By Me

Our appliances and various devices are designed with a focus on energy efficiency, often leading to compromises in terms of durability or increased expenses in certain aspects. This raises the question of the potential for significant reductions in the cost of energy or electricity in a prospective future, which could profoundly impact the trade-offs involved in engineering decisions. It is conceivable that this shift could prompt a reevaluation of our approach to constructing certain devices, where prioritizing factors other than efficiency may yield more substantial benefits that hold greater significance.

Take charity for example. Charity usually means one of two things, pardoning an unpardonable act or loving an unlovable person. Or take love. Love's an even better one. To love means loving the unlovable. To forgive means pardoning the unpardonable. Faith means believing the unbelievable. And hope means hoping even when everything seems hopeless.

Changing your mind is not a sign of losing integrity. It's often a mark of gaining wisdom. Realizing you were wrong doesn't mean you lack judgment. It means you lacked knowledge. Opinions are what you think today. Growth comes from staying open to revising your views tomorrow.
Adam Grant

On social media I get a lot of people writing to me saying, “Why won’t you notice me?” I wanna write them back and say, “Me noticing you will never satisfy your deep craving unless you notice you first.” But I won’t write that, because most people cannot really hear that simple truth. What people are subconsciously asking is for proof that they actually exist. We all want validation, proof of life, but it must come from you. From the inside out, rather than the outside in.

Conhecemos as pessoas pelo acaso, mas elas não continuam na nossa vida pelo acaso.

I've been very vocal on saying the standard in this area is crap. And we're going to ignore the standard because the standard is wrong.

We may be fault, unpredictable, unlogic. Some may think that we should not let personal feelings cloud our search for the truth. Feelings may not be convenient, the may slow our progress, but they are also the way to understand humans.

Wisdom is not the ability to solve a problem, but the ability to understand which problem to solve.

So they start to try to institutionalize process across the company. Before long, people get confused that the process is the content. That's ultimately the downfall of IBM. IBM has the best process people in the world. They just forgot about the content. That's a little bit of what happened at Apple too. We had people who were great at management process. They just didn't have a clue as to the content... That was makes treat products, is the content, not the process.
